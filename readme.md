### Maker Pattern

We are proposing here the creation of the make-pattern for development.<br/>
The idea is to use the advantages of wrapers in JavaScript to implement "interface" for useful, well known patterns or features, such as observables, web workers, throttling, debouncing, indexable, models, singletons, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas and suggestions are quite welcome, specially if you want to make something here better or add new makers.
